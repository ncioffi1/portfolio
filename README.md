# Introduction

Hey!  You've found my portfolio repository.  That's awesome, dude.

This portfolio was created with JavaScript, React.js, and HTML / CSS.  It also utilizes the JS animation library GSAP.  The GSAP bits took quite a bit of tweaking, but overall I'm happy with how it turned out!

I mainly built this as an exercise in getting familiar with JavaScript animations to potentially give a higher bit of polish to my sites.  

Thanks for reading!
